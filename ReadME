## CloudGuard  Cloud Security Threat Detection and Alert Infrasturcture

The primary goal was to improve the 3-tier web app I had previously built by introducing automation, scalability, and a serverless architecture. 

**check out the initial infrastructure:** https://github.com/Divine-cell/FinBloom

The entire infrastructure is provisioned, managed, and maintained solely through Terraform configuration files.

## Architectural Diagram

The application follows a standard serverless 3-Tier model, ensuring high availability (across 2 Availability Zones), security, and fast content delivery.

## Architecture Breakdown






# CloudGuard  Cloud Security Threat Detection and Alert Infrasturcture

**CloudGuard** is a cloud security architecture using Terraform to design, monitor cloud environments, detect threats, and send real-time alerts to a team via Slack. 

## Solution Overview
CloudGuard provides a fully automated workflow to detect and alert team on cloud security threats in when it happens.  

**Workflow:**
1. Fpr this project, EC2 instances simulate threats using Bash scripts.
2. **GuardDuty** detects threats and sends findings to **Security Hub**.
3. **EventBridge** imports findings and triggers a **Lambda** function.
4. Lambda checks **DynamoDB** for existing finding IDs.
   - If ID does not exist → send alert to Slack and save ID with TTL.
   - If ID exists → do not send alert (prevents duplicates).
5. **Batch optimization:** Lambda groups findings by **instance ID** to reduce alert noise.
6. Alerts are delivered to Slack in a concise, actionable format.


## Architecture
The architecture is designed to leverage AWS managed services for scalable and automated threat detection and notification.

## AWS Services Used
CloudTrail: To provide an audit trail and source for threat detection           
GuardDuty:  To detects malicious activity in the cloud enviroment automatically                           
Security Hub: Aggregates findings from multiple services 
EventBridge: Triggers Lambda function automatically when new findings are imported  
Lambda:  Processes findings and sends alerts to Slack            
DynamoDB: To Store finding IDs with TTL(Time To Live) and prevent duplicate alerts on slack
EC2 + Bash: To simulates threats in the cloud environment providing scenarios to test monitorig security setup    |
